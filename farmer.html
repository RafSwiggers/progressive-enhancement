<p>
  Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class ="neighbors">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class ="neighbors">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said,<q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>
</p>

<p>
  The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class ="neighbors">Oh dear, that’s too <span class="cap" id="bad">bad</span>.</q> and the farmer responded, <qclass="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class ="neighbors"> Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><span class="cap" id="good">good</span> and <span class="cap" id="bad">bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="cap" id="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="cap" id="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
